# 📈 Longitudinal Data Analysis - Project Repository  

## 📌 About This Repository  
This repository contains projects conducted as part of the **Longitudinal Data Analysis** course. The course focuses on statistical methods for analyzing **repeated measurements over time** and handling **incomplete data**.  

## 📚 Course Overview  
This course provides a deep dive into modeling **longitudinal and incomplete data**, covering:  
- **Linear Mixed Models (LMMs):** Handling correlation within repeated measures.  
- **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE):** Population-averaged approaches for non-Gaussian data.  
- **Handling Missing Data:** Sensitivity analyses and multiple imputation.  

## 📂 Project Contents  
This repository contains the following projects:  
- **📊 Linear Mixed Effects Models for Patient Response Over Time**  
- **📌 GEE Approach to Analyzing Repeated Measures in Clinical Trials**  
- **🕵️‍♂️ Handling Missing Data in Longitudinal Studies: A Sensitivity Analysis**  

Each project includes:  
✔️ **Data preprocessing & exploratory analysis**  
✔️ **Model implementation in R/SAS**  
✔️ **Interpretation of model outputs**
